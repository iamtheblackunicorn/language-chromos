# CHROMOS GRAMMAR :rainbow: :scroll:

*A grammar for the Chromos language for Atom.* :rainbow: :scroll:

## About :books:

This repository contains a grammar for the Chromos language for the Atom editor. This means that when you write Chromos code, this theme will make syntax higlighting possible inside the Atom editor. You can find out more about the Atom editor [here](https://atom.io) and the Chromos language [here](https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/Chromos).

## Installation :inbox_tray:

- 1.) Make sure that Atom is installed.
- 2.) Download this repository.
- 3.) Move the downloaded repository to your system's `.atom` directory.
